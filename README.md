## 📇 About The Project

> *TLDR* - **NextConf Realtime Clone using Supabase Realtime**

I was heavily inspired by [Next Conf](https://nextjs.org/conf#room-9q0s8)  realtime ⌚ functionalities, and take some time on learning how Next implement it.  Seems like they are using [Replicache](https://doc.replicache.dev/how-it-works) to implement the `Push/Pull` realtime functionalities.

Then I look around the internet and couldn't find any similar example, thus inspired me to take on the challenge, and utilizing [Supabase Realtime ⚡](https://supabase.io/docs/reference/javascript/subscribe) to replicate similar effect.

After long hour of studying and replicating, I'm proud to present this **Open Source Supabase Realtime NextConf Clone** Playground 🔥

> ⚠️ If you encountered any bugs🐛, please report it so that I can prepare my Bug Spray!
